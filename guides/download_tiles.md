# How to download tiles?

## Direct download

You can download tiles for the whole planet from the official site [download.versatiles.org](https://download.versatiles.org/).

To make downloading easier, you can use `wget`. The `-c` flag can be added to resume an interrupted download:

```bash
wget -c "https://download.versatiles.org/osm.versatiles"
```

## Partial download

If you only need tiles for a specific region, like a continent or a country, you can use VersaTiles to download them. Filters can be applied to specify minimum and maximum zoom levels, as well as a geographical bounding box.

For example, to download only tiles for Switzerland (including 3 tiles as border):
```bash
versatiles convert --bbox-border 3 --bbox "5.956,45.818,10.492,47.808" https://download.versatiles.org/osm.versatiles switzerland.versatiles
```

Or, very similarly, how to download Germany
```bash
versatiles convert --bbox-border 3 --bbox "5.988,47.302,15.017,54.983" https://download.versatiles.org/osm.versatiles germany.versatiles
```
~~~shell
versatiles convert --bbox-border 3 --bbox "5.988,47.302,15.017,54.983" --min-zoom 10 --max-zoom 14  https://download.versatiles.org/planet-latest.versatiles germany.versatiles

## Downloading to Google Cloud Storage

To store VersaTiles data on Google Cloud Storage, follow these steps:

- **Prepare a Google Cloud Storage Bucket**  
  Follow the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) to create a new bucket.

- **Copy the Latest Data**  
  Transfer "osm.versatiles" file from [download.versatiles.org](https://download.versatiles.org/) to your bucket. There are 3 ways to do that:

  1. **Automated Transfer**
    - Navigate to "Bucket details" and click on "TRANSFER DATA", then "Transfer data in".
    - Select "Source type: URL list" and proceed to the next step.
    - Enter "https://download.versatiles.org/urllist.tsv" as the "URL of TSV file" and proceed.
    - Specify your bucket and folder as the destination, and continue.
    - Opt for "Run once", "Starting now", and finalize by clicking "CREATE".
    - Monitor the transfer status [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/transfer/jobs).
    - Note: Transfer speed may be limited to around 10 MB/s for unspecified reasons.

   2. **Manual Transfer**
    - Use `wget` or `curl` to download the file and `gscloud` to upload it, if you have a high-speed internet connection.

   3. **Google VM Transfer**
    - Alternatively, use a Google Compute Engine VM for both downloading and uploading.

- **Set Public Access**  
  The bucket or the file must be set to [public access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public).
  <details><summary>Why Public Access is Required</summary>
  VersaTiles currently does not support Google Cloud authentication. Therefore, public access is necessary for HTTPS retrieval. Future versions may include support for Google Cloud Run's automatic authentication.
